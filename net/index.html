                <p>PKMN is an app for Pokémon RBY and GSC. It calculates DVs and shows
                    learnsets, evolutions and the details of known moves. No need to insert
                    data into calculators or search online: PKMN shows you the info for the
                    Pokémon you have selected in the game. It reads directly from the screen
                    and processes everything in the browser; no data leaves your
                    computer!</p>

                <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
                <p>The app is intended for the English version of Pokémon RBY and GSC.
                    However, it may function partially for other language variants as well.
                    For example, the DV calculation is known to work with Pokémon Gelbe
                    Edition.</p>
                <p>PKMN can scan emulators, screenshots and videos – if the conditions
                    are met. The game screen needs to be fully visible, to have the original
                    10:9 aspect ratio, to have no direct white borders and to be not blurry
                    or distorted. The Super Game Boy borders need to be disabled. Scanning
                    is not expected to work with photos taken with a camera.</p>
                <p>The DV calculation works for recently caught Pokémon. Through
                    battling and consuming certain items, Pokémon gain stat experience that
                    contributes to their total stat values. As this experience is hidden,
                    the calculator assumes it to be 0. Bulbapedia describes <a
                        href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Effort_values#Stat_experience"
                        target="_blank">stat
                        experience<i aria_hidden="true" class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> in more details.</p>
                <p>DVs are calculated from the level, the base stat and the current stat
                    value of a Pokémon. Finer details, such as the shared DV value for Spc.
                    Att and Spc. Def, the effects of Gen II gender and the connection
                    between the HP DV and other DVs are not yet taken into account. To learn

                <p>The app was tested with Firefox on PC.</p>
                <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>When encountering issues, following these steps can generally solve
                    the majority of them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refresh the page.</li>
                    <li>Select the screen or window that shows the game.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that there is no white border directly around the Game Boy
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>Disable the Super Game Boy borders.</li>
                    <li>Use the original 10:9 aspect ratio for the game.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that the screen is fully visible. Avoid covering the game
                        with the cursor.</li>
                    <li>Experiment with resizing the screen, especially if not using the
                        original resolution.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that the game shows the Pokémon summary (stats)
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>When multiple games are visible, the one with the bigger screen will
                        be scanned.</li>
                    <li>Click “Show snapshot” to see the image that was scanned last.</li>
                    <li>Click “Show screen” to show the window or screen that the app
                        receives as input.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With the help of the error messages, this process may be
                    simplified.</p>
                <p><strong>expected image with minimal size of 160x144, got
                        1x1</strong>:<br />
                    This error appears if the source window is minimized.</p>
                <p><strong>could not locate Game Boy screen</strong>:<br />
                    The Game Boy screen was not found on the shared window or screen. Make
                    sure it is indeed there. The game needs to be fully visible (mind the
                    cursor), in the original 10:9 aspect ratio and have no white borders
                    around. The Super Game Boy borders need to be disabled.</p>
                <p><strong>could not recognize screen layout</strong>:<br />
                    This error indicates that the Game Boy screen was found (likely
                    correctly) and the game screen is not recognized. First, make sure that
                    the game shows a Pokémon summary (stats) screen. Having the cursor on
                    the Game Boy screen can also be a cause.</p>
                <p><strong>could not determine XXX DV range: stat value not found in
                        stat variation XXX</strong>:<br />
                    This error appears if a stat has an unexpected(ly high) value. The
                    Pokémon likely gained stat experience through battling or consuming
                    certain items. The DV can not be calculated just from the visible stats
                    anymore.</p>
                <p><strong>could not read XXX: could not read character #X: could not
                        recognize character</strong>:<br />
                    A specific field could not be read because a character (letter) is not
                    recognized. The game should be fully visible and not even the cursor
                    should covers the texts. Make sure the image is not blurry and try
                    resizing the game screen until the error goes away.</p>
                <p>If in doubt, use the “Show snapshot” button to to see the image that
                    was scanned last, and the “Show screen” to see the window or screen that
                    the app receives as input.</p>
