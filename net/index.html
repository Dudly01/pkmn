                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>PKMN is a Pokémon RBY (Gen I) and GSC (Gen II) DV calculator, move and evolution lister.<br>
                    It aides trainers with their journey of becoming the champion.</p>

                <p>See the potential of the freshly caught Pokémon.<br>
                    Spare effort by focusing only on the very best, without the hassle of DV calculators.</p>

                <p>Read the details and side effects of the moves.<br>
                    Battle confidently without learning from trial-and-error.</p>

                <p>See the evolutions of your Pokémon, when and what moves they learn through leveling up.<br>
                    Raise your partner without missing a crucial move. No need to keep several browser tabs open.</p>

                <p>Read directly from the Game Boy screen, process in the browser.<br>
                    No data leaves the computer. No program needs to be installed.</p>

                <h2>Quickstart</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Select the screen with the Game Boy on it.</li>
                    <li>Select to scan once or periodically.</li>
                    <li>Check the result of the scan.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>

                <p>The app works with the English version of Pokémon RBY (Gen I) and GSC (Gen II).</p>

                <p>Scanning works with Game Boy emulators, images, and videos within certain conditions.
                    The image needs to be clean, to have the original width-height ratio, and to not have a white
                    border.
                    Upon failure, the error is presented to the user.</p>

                <p>The tool can only approximate the DVs of freshly caught Pokémon precisely.
                    Through battles, Pokémon gain stat experience that affects their stat value.
                    As the accumulated amount of this experience is hidden from the player, the calculator assumes it to
                    be zero.
                    Therefore the more experience is gained, the less accurate the DV approximation is.</p>

                <p>The stat DVs are calculated separately from one another.
                    Details like the shared DV value for Spc. Att and Spc. Def, the relation of HP DV to other stat DVs,
                    or the effects of gender in Gen II, are not considered.</p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

                <p>This section will continue the troubleshooting steps.
                    Until then, make sure the Game Boy screen has a dark border and has the original aspect ratio.</p>

                <p>If the screen or a field is not recognized, try resizing the image until success.
                    Using a Game Boy resolution other than the original 160x144 can introduce distortions.
                    This can prevent the characters from being recognized.</p>
