                <p>PKMN is an app for Pokémon RBY and GSC. It calculates DVs and shows
                    learnsets, evolutions and the details of known moves and held items. No
                    need to insert data into calculators or search online: PKMN shows you
                    the info for the Pokémon you have selected in the game. It reads
                    directly from the screen and processes everything in the browser; no
                    data leaves your computer!</p>

                <h2 id="details">Details</h2>
                <p>The PKMN was created for the English version of Pokémon RBY and GSC.
                    Nonetheless, it may have partial functionality with other language
                    variants as well. As an example, the DV calculation also works with
                    Pokémon Gelbe Edition.</p>
                <p>The app works with emulators, screenshots and videos – if the
                    conditions are met. The game screen needs to be in the original 10:9
                    aspect ratio, to be fully visible (mind the cursor), to have no white
                    borders directly around it and to be neither blurry nor distorted. It is
                    not expected to work with photos taken with a camera. Super Game Boy
                    borders may be enabled.</p>
                <figure>
                    <div class="multi-img-figure">

                <p>The DV calculation works for recently caught Pokémon. Through battles
                    and by consuming certain items, Pokémon gain stat experience that
                    contributes to their total stat values. As this experience is hidden,
                    the calculator assumes it to be 0. Calculating the DV of a Pokémon that
                    collected plenty of this experience will be inaccurate or will result in
                    an error. Read more about stat experience on <a

                <p>The DV calculation has other limitations. Finer details, such as the
                    shared DV value for Spc. Att and Spc. Def, the effects of Gen II gender
                    and the connection between the HP DV and other DVs are not yet taken
                    into account. Read more about stats and DVs on <a

                <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>When encountering issues, following these steps should solve the
                    majority of them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refresh the page.</li>
                    <li>Select the screen or window that shows the game screen.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the game is in the original 10:9 aspect ratio.</li>
                    <li>Make sure there are no white borders directly around the game
                        screen.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the screen is fully visible. Mind your cursor.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the game shows the Pokémon summary (STATS) screen.</li>
                    <li>Try resizing the game screen.</li>
                    <li>Click “Show snapshot” to see the image that was scanned last.</li>
                    <li>Click “Show screen” to show the window or screen that the app
                        receives as input.</li>
                    <li>When multiple games are visible, the one with the bigger screen will
                        be scanned.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With the help of the error messages, this process may be
                    simplified.</p>
                <p><strong>expected image with minimal size of 160x144, got
                        1x1</strong>:<br />
                    This error appears if the source window is minimized.</p>
                <p><strong>could not locate Game Boy screen</strong>:<br />
                    The Game Boy screen was not found on the shared window or screen. Make
                    sure it is indeed there. The game needs to be fully visible (mind the
                    cursor), in the original 10:9 aspect ratio and have no white borders
                    around it.</p>
                <p><strong>could not recognize screen layout</strong>:<br />
                    This error indicates that the Game Boy screen was found (likely
                    correctly) and the game screen is not recognized. Make sure that the
                    game shows a Pokémon summary (stats) screen. Having the cursor on the
                    Game Boy screen can also cause this error.</p>
                <p><strong>could not determine XXX DV range: stat value not found in
                        stat variation XXX</strong>:<br />
                    This error appears if a stat has an unexpected(ly high) value. The
                    Pokémon likely gained stat experience through battles or by consuming
                    certain items. The DV can not be calculated just from the visible stats
                    anymore.</p>
                <p><strong>could not read XXX: could not read character #X: could not
                        recognize character</strong>:<br />
                    A specific field could not be read because a character (Latin letter or
                    digit) is not recognized. The game should be fully visible and not even
                    the cursor should cover the texts. Make sure the game is not blurry. Try
                    resizing it until the error goes away.</p>
                <p>If in doubt, use the “Show snapshot” button to see the image that was
                    scanned last, and use the “Show screen” button to see the window or
                    screen that the app receives as input.</p>
