## Quickstart

1. Select the screen with the Game Boy on it.
2. Select to scan once or periodically.
3. Check the result of the scan.

## Limitations

The app works with the English version of Pokémon RBY (Gen I) and GSC (Gen II).

Scanning works with Game Boy emulators, images and videos within certain conditions.
The image needs to be clean, to have the original width-height ratio, and to not have a white border.
Upon failure, the error is presented to the user.

The tool can only approximate the DVs of freshly caught Pokémon precisely.
Through battles, Pokémon gain stat experience that affects their stat value.
As the accumulated amount of this experience is hidden from the player, the calculator assumes it to be zero.
Therefore the more experience is gained, the less accurate the DV approximation is.

The stat DVs are calculated separately from one another.
Details like the shared DV value for Spc. Att and Spc. Def, the relation of HP DV to other stat DVs, or the effects of gender in Gen II, are not considered.

## Troubleshooting

This section will continue the troubleshooting steps.
Until then, make sure the Game Boy screen has a dark border and has the original aspect ratio.

If the screen or a field is not recognized, try resizing the image until success.
Using a Game Boy resolution other than the original 160x144 can introduce distortions.
This can prevent the characters from being recognized.
