A tool for estimating the DVs of a Pok√©mon.


# Troubleshooting

## Build WASM code

https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/setup.html

cargo install wasm-pack

```
wasm-pack build --target web
```

## Local webserver

To view the examples it's best to start a local webserver from the repo's directory. In Python3, this can be done with:

```
python -m http.server
```

Afterwards, one can visit http://localhost:8000/ which will show `index.html` by default. Other `.html` files can be accessed with their relative paths.
